## **Style Guide: Retro 80s Pixel UI**

This document outlines the key design elements and components used in the provided reference images to achieve a retro 80s pixelated, "synthwave" aesthetic.

### **1. Color Palette**

The color scheme is a quintessential element of this style, characterized by a dark background with vibrant, neon-like accent colors.

*   **Primary Background:** Dark purple or near-black (`#1A0C2B` or similar). This makes the foreground elements pop.
*   **Primary Text & UI Elements:** Bright, saturated colors.
    *   **Cyan/Teal:** Used for headlines and important text (`#00FFFF` style).
    *   **Bright Purple/Magenta:** Used for buttons and highlights (`#D900FF` style).
    *   **Vibrant Yellow/Gold:** Used for secondary buttons and navigation (`#FFD700` style).
*   **Accent Glows:** The same vibrant colors (cyan, magenta, yellow) are used to create a "neon glow" effect around text and containers.

### **2. Typography**

The font is a critical component for achieving the retro video game feel.

*   **Font Style:** A pixelated, 8-bit, or bitmap font. It features blocky letterforms with sharp, aliased edges (no anti-aliasing).
*   **Characteristics:**
    *   Monospaced or near-monospaced appearance.
    *   Consistent stroke width.
    *   Often all-caps for headings and buttons.
*   **Implementation:** Look for free or commercial pixel fonts with names like "Press Start 2P," "VT323," or "8-Bit Operator." These can be embedded in your project.
*   **Text Effects:** A subtle outer glow in a contrasting neon color is often applied to headings to make them stand out.

### **3. UI Components**

The components are designed with simple shapes and enhanced with retro effects.

#### **A. Buttons**

Buttons are prominent, colorful, and have a distinct, chunky feel.

*   **Shape:** Rectangular with sharp, 90-degree corners.
*   **Text:** Uses the primary pixel font, typically in all-caps.
*   **Style:**
    *   **Fill:** A solid, vibrant color (e.g., magenta or yellow).
    *   **Border:** A slightly darker shade of the fill color or a contrasting dark color to create a subtle 3D or beveled effect.
    *   **Glow Effect:** A soft outer glow in the same color as the button's fill is applied to give it a neon, illuminated appearance.
    *   **Hover State (Implied):** When a user hovers over a button, the glow could intensify, or the brightness could increase to provide feedback.

#### **B. Containers & Cards**

Content is organized into distinct cards or containers that float over the background.

*   **Shape:** Rectangular with slightly rounded corners.
*   **Background:** A semi-transparent dark color (a darker shade of the main background purple) to separate it from the main background while maintaining a cohesive look.
*   **Border/Frame:** This is the key feature. The container is framed by a thin, bright, neon-glowing line.
    *   The glow is typically in a primary accent color like cyan or magenta.
    *   The border itself is a solid line, and the glow emanates from it.
*   **Content:** Inside the container, text and other elements are laid out with clear spacing.

#### **C. Navigation Bar**

The top navigation bar uses button styles similar to the main action buttons but for site-wide links.

*   **Style:** A series of glowing yellow buttons with rounded corners, grouped together.
*   **Text:** Uses the pixel font.
*   **Arrangement:** Horizontally arranged at the top of the page.

### **4. Effects & Finishes**

These effects tie all the components together to create the final aesthetic.

*   **Neon Glow:** This is the most important effect. It's applied to:
    *   **Text:** Especially headings.
    *   **Buttons:** To make them feel interactive and illuminated.
    *   **Containers:** To define sections and add to the vibrant, futuristic feel.
    *   **Implementation:** This can be achieved in CSS using the `box-shadow` property for containers/buttons and the `text-shadow` property for text. Multiple layered shadows with increasing blur and decreasing opacity create a realistic glow.

*   **Pixelation:** The core theme is reinforced by the consistent use of pixel fonts and, where applicable, pixel art icons. The sharp, aliased edges of fonts and borders are crucial; avoid any smoothing or anti-aliasing effects.

### **How to Apply to a TTS Project**

*   **Main Interface:** Use the dark purple background. Place your text input field and TTS controls inside a "Container/Card" with a glowing cyan border.
*   **"Speak" Button:** Style this as a primary "Button" using the vibrant magenta or yellow color, complete with a neon glow.
*   **Options/Settings:** If you have dropdowns for voices or speed controls, style them using the same pixel font and dark background/light text color scheme.
*   **Text Display:** The text generated by the TTS could be displayed in the primary cyan pixel font to match the headings.
